# SeatGeek

This project was a coding exercise for a take home test.

The task: Create an iOS application that would consume the open-source SeatGeek API and display events in a UITableView as shown in the below screenshots. To search an event UISearchBar should be used and it should be placed on the top of the UITableView. The application needs to fetch relevant events from SeatGeek API while user is typing in the search bar. Tapping on Event UITableViewCell should display the corresponding event in a detail screen. Tapping on the back button should take user back to the events tableview. User should be able to favorite events from the detail screen by hitting the favorite button. Favorited events should be displayed on the events tableview as shown below. Even when searching or closing the application, a favorited event should remain favorited. A user should be able to unfavorite the event as well.

The client_id and client_secret required to use the API have been removed.
